### Backstory
This computer found its way to me through [Pionir free school](https://pionir.org) where it was bought for 100 RSD (a bit under EUR 1 at the time). Since, this little box has become an obsession for me and a few students. As a strong beliver of hardware reuse and freedom, I belive that instructions here may provide a second (or third) life to this machine for many years to come. Our net4501 is still operating as a network learning box at Pionir.
